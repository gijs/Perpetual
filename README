Tomasz Marian Tunik's JavaSript playground and perpetual attempt at making something significant. Moslty html5 2d/webgl canvas stuff.

Utilities:
- Timer - requestAnimationFrame based, using 3 models - simple (update + render linked), deterministic (const update intervals + render) and simple (only render loop)
- Camera2d - allows to pan/zoom view on the canvas and set scale or invert y axis of canvas
- Vec2 - 2d vector math as set of static methods
- M2 - simple 2d matrix for transformations
- u.js - dif utilities and helpers - extend (inheritance), clamp, map, max, min, randInt, randFloat, TO_RADIANS, TO_DEGREES.. and growing

Datastructures:
- scene/dependency graph - with canvas and HTML5 renderers
- quadtree - QuadTree.js

Examples:
- scene graph, children nodes transformations test
- quad tree indexing - quadtree indexing visualisation
- quad tree collisions
- brute force collisions - for comparison
- three.js - simple test of wrapping it in perpetual-style structure
- basic webgl with triangles drawing - nothign fancy, just regular
- and others...
